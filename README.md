# spotify-playlist-archive-src

This repository contains the source code for
- [mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive) (old repo)
- [mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive-2](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive-2) (new repo)

I split out the source code because the original repo is so large that it makes
local development difficult. With a separate repo, I can work on the source code
without the burden of the playlist data.
